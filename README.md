# Tensorflow-Practice
Implementation of various Neural Network Architectures using TensorFlow v2 


This tutorial was designed for easily diving into TensorFlow, through examples. For readability, it includes both notebooks and source codes with explanation, for both TF v1 & v2.

It is suitable for beginners who want to find clear and concise examples about TensorFlow. Besides the traditional 'raw' TensorFlow implementations, you can also find the latest TensorFlow API practices (such as `layers`, `estimator`, `dataset`, ...).

Readme will guide you step by step towards learning TF
